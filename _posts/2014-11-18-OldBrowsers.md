##Old Browsers
I think that when it comes to developing for old browsers they should certainly be considered in the design process but not the
primary concern.  I think that the other browsers like chrome or firefox are going to be what you should spend the most time and effort developing for to begin with.  Then go back and think about how it looks on Internet Explorer.  We know that it comprises about roughly a little over a half of the browser market according to [netmarketshar.com](http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&qpcustomd=0) which I found as a surprise.  Clearly you can't just ignore all those users.  

I wanted to figure out why and how this many people are using a crappy browser so I did a little digging.  I noticed in my research that a lot of that traffic and users are coming from big business or corporate type office setups where you don't have much of a choice or so says [howtogeek.com](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32372/htg-explains-why-do-so-many-geeks-hate-internet-explorer/).  This means that the demographic of the users are probably a bit older and most likely a person who is doing a 9 to 5 type office job.  This is also only one location of browsing and internet use for those people.  So think about what the content of your site is and would people look at it at work or something like that.  Also, i'd think that they all still browse on their phones while at work, have a tablet, or laptop too they may use.

Most people in the real world will take the time to make sure whatever it is they develop at least degrades gracefully to function on even the older versions of Internet Explorer.  So I would say it couldn't hurt to check and see if whatever you make is still at least functional on a basic level on those browsers that would be 3 years or older.  I know I still keep a version of Internet Explorer around just for incase.  Overall, I don't think that Internet Explorer is going away anytime soon which is sad but means its something we will always have to consider when developing.  Well at least for the next few years or until chrome completes its global conquest.
