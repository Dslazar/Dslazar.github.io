##Why I'm Here

I've always had an interest in web development because from an early age i've needed to create content for the web.  It started off with simple HTML back in the day on myspace etc.  Shortly after that I started making a custom website for my band then my friends bands and so on.  In the years after highschool I didn't actually ever study about web development.  Then in the summer of 2009 I got a job at a marketing and advertising agency as a front end web developer.  I worked there for about 3 and a half years where I really got to work on my coding chops.  

After a few years of that I decided to go back to school and formally study web dev.  So now i'm here at Columbia College!  I feel like the timing couldn't have worked out better because the industry is always changing and evolving so what better time to be learning.
