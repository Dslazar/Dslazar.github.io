##New Media Stories

I reall like the way new media allows for gret pieces like "A Game of Shark and Minow" to exist.  For the longest time I always 
thought that someone should come up with a way to tell a story in which the paratext and other cool goodnies were embeded right 
in the experience.  I like how this medium allows for the use of many type of content from video to audio as well as the traditional 
text and images.  I also think that it helps the reader or user stay a bit more engaged than in traditional media.  It seems that the
interactivity of the scrolling is fun too for me anyways.

I can see how many would find that distracting or a bit too busy.  I think that the interactive maps and movement really don't detract
from the experience in fact I think because they are done really well it seems natural.  In particular their use of bacground changes 
and motions to signify this are what make it work.  Same goes for a few of their other pieces I check out on the site.
