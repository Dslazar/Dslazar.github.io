     title: Native VS Web Apps
--- 

##Native Apps or Web Apps; Which is better?

As time goes on I really start to think of the arguement between which of the two is better in the same way I think of the whole apples vs oranges debate.  There are great uses for both but niether really cross over well.   In the beginning it was all native apps because they were the hot new thing for ipohne.  Then the android market starting getting into the app game.  They quickly started to get a good foothold in the market place partly because i think they made it really easier for developers to get their content out their unlike Apple did for iphones.  All this hype was partly because web apps hadn't had the time or technology to be relevant yet.  Chronologically speaking al this was going on before HTML 5 was out yet.  

To me the only cool thing about native apps is that depending on what the purpose of the app is they don't require an internet connection ike 3G or wifi.  Things like my metronome app or guitar tuner app although possible to do on a web app would defeat the purpose.  Chances are i'm going to be in a room with my instrument only not a computer let alone a good internet connection.
The key difference to me that should be considered before developing either a web or native app is what, who, and where are people going to be using or interacting with my content.  Plus with apps like that Native apps cann access the phones functions like the microphones and speakers.  

However, now that web technologies have caught up and are really even starting to surpass native app capabilites I see things going in that direction.  With wireless internet like 4G already being faster than the average broadband connection I think that web apps are going to be the front runner going forward in the future.  The number of new mobile devices hitting the market that have internet access on them is astounding.  The price difference between that and what people would consider a smart phone now is pretty significant too.

When it comes to the development side of things I would say that it I would steer a person towards the web app direction simply because it is so much easier to make something that you can distribute to a larger audience.  I would say that there is a bit more money in developing large native apps that have specific unique or proprietary functionality but those clients are far and few between.  I would think that the majority of people are looking for sometime of widget or plugin type web app for their site or users of their product or business services.
