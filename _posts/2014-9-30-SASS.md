##SASS

When it comes to the redundancies and overall cumbersome nature of css I can see why it led developers to come up with a 
pre processing system like SASS, LESS, or Stylus.  The fact that they all let you nest and use variables is pretty nice because
then you don't have to use change 10 things when all you want to do is adjust one color.  I tend to agree with the author of the
first article called the problem with CSS pre-processors.  Mainly because i'm in the same boat he is in that I learned from the
begginning how to scale and maintain a large style sheet so I am pretty well set in my ways.  I also liked his comment about how it really depends on the 
project he is coding because lately I have been doing a lot of one off sites that won't really need tobe changed or updated in the
near forseeable future.  I can see the benefits of learning how the pre processesors work and will for sure get around to it for my
own benfit and employment.  Plus i'm sure it will only make my css coding better.
