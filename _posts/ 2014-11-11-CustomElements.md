##Custom Elements
I was a bit hesitant at first as to what the value of a custom element might be if it even had any at all but now I have begun to understand their value.  To me I kind of like to think of them as custom variables in a more traditional programming sense.   I also like the logic behind them and how that are all Javascript too.  Not that I think it would be as robust as a wordpress backend or other CMS system but I think you could have some similar opportunities.  I for some reason keep thinking that with a small link that uses a password a simple backend could be made that switches out the content of certain P tags or other simple textual things.  Sor of similar to how we updated the score on the game example.  

I do wonder about how things will play out as all browsers adopt this and more custom elements are created.  Right now I don't see any immediate problems but I do see them becoming a bit like wordpress plugins in the sense that a lot of them are going to be useless and poorly made.  I also think it may leave certain vulnerabilities in people's code, potentially anyhow.  They could possibly even run out of original naming conventions which would be an interesting problem to overcome.

I think these can bad things can all be overlooked though because it provides a lot of easy to use benefits for other users not so interested in coding but really just need a simple webstie.  Everything from layouts and custom modules of functionality could easily be obtained from something like the custom elements gallery.
