Inert template idea is cool for swapping things oout and saving band with.
Shadow Dom is pretty great because it alows you to make things like iframes much more user friendly without JS.  Also the input
date tag that has the built in calender features like that are also really neat and useful.  I like how as he put it the stuff is
already built into the browser and they have been holding out on us.
the encapsulated style tag idea is great because a lot of the time these are going to be secondary components that you make post
site design.  it just seems like a time saver if you want to add custom things once the whole site is designed and stylized
without having to go back in and change all your CSS.  
The insertion point idea was pretty great too because you can essentially start making variable for traits and qualities you know
you are going to use all the time.  Plus another benefit is that you can use custom names for these variable which makes the 
organizationon the backend.  

Overall I seee this as the best improvement to web development in a long while.  I thikn the beauty of this is that when adopted
by all browsers it may start to elminate all the confusion between languages that browsers use and accept.  I've always thought
that having to know HTML,CSS,JS,Jquery,PHP, Ruby, Python, etc... was a bit cumbersome because all of them are really serving the 
same purpose which is to create content for the web.  This way everything is wrapped up nice and neat in one language.  And it 
works on the logic principles of standard programming languages like C# and C based languages.
